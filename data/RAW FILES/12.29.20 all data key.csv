2871,Consent,"HSP Pretesting Principal Investigator: Dr. Steve Heine, UBC Department of Psychology Phone: 604-822-6908. Email: heine@psych.ubc.ca Introduction and Purpose: The purpose of this study is to collect information about your feelings, attitudes, past experiences, and personal characteristics. Researchers may use this information to screen you for other studies in the Human Subjects Pool (HSP) for which you may qualify. Researchers may also use this information to link pre-testing responses to data that was collected in a laboratory setting, past or future pre-testing questionnaires, or to collect data on an independent research project using questionnaires included in the pretesting survey. Collection of pre-testing data: If you decide to participate, you will be asked to complete a series of questions. These questions reflect the diverse interests of members of the Psychology department, and therefore the questions will span a broad range of topics, including some topics you might consider sensitive; specifically, this pretesting survey includes questions about your ethnocultural background, religious beliefs and affiliations, sexual practices, past or present physical health conditions or mental illness/mental health issues, and personal attitudes. There are no known risks associated with the collection of pre-testing data, and no known conflicts of interest on the part of the researchers. If you have any questions at anytime about the procedures or your involvement feel free to ask the researchers. Potential Risks: By responding to the pre-testing survey online, you will face the same kinds of risk to confidentiality that occurs whenever you enter personal information over the internet. However, every effort will be made to minimize these risks (e.g., the HSP website automatically encrypts the responses you enter). Potential Benefits: There are no benefits for participants, aside from the opportunity to learn about psychological research and to be directed toward studies that are relevant to them. Compensation: For your participation, you will receive one half-credit in the HSP system. Confidentiality: Any information you provide in the collection of pre-testing data will be kept strictly confidential. You will be asked to create a code number, which will be linked to the pre-testing responses you provide. If a researcher wishes to access your pre-testing data when you later complete a particular study, they will ask you to provide this code number; whether to do so is entirely at your discretion. Only HSP administrators will be able to access the data linking your name and code number, and this data will be stored on a password-protected and encrypted computer in a locked office. In addition, if your pre-testing responses indicate that you meet the qualifications for particular studies, these studies will be automatically displayed to you by the online sign-up system; therefore, if you choose to sign up for a given study, the researchers will assume that you meet the qualifying criteria. Furthermore, some researchers may wish to contact you directly to invite you to participate in their study, based on the answer you provided to an item in the pretesting survey. If you would like to be contacted for future research based on your answer to an item, you will have an opportunity to submit your name and email address.  Contact: If you have any other questions or desire further information with respect to the collection of pre-testing data, please contact Zachary Witkower (Email: hspresearch@psych.ubc.ca).Contact for concerns about the rights of research subjects: If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, contact the Research Participant Complaint Line in the UBC Office of Research Ethics at 604-822-8598 or if long distance e-mail RSIL@ors.ubc.ca or call toll free 1-877-822-8598. Consent: Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you may refuse to participate or withdraw from the study at any time. You can do this by emailing hspresearch@psych.ubc.ca, and requesting that your data be deleted. You will not be penalized in any way should you choose not to participate or withdraw. Checking the box below indicates that you have received a copy of this consent form for your records. Checking the box below also indicates that you consent to participate in the pre-testing. Separate informed consent forms will be provided for future studies related to HSP.",19
