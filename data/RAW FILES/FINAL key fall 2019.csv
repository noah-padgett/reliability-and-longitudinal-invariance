128,Consent,"Principal Investigator: Dr. Steve Heine, UBC Department of Psychology. Phone: 604-822-6908. Email: heine@psych.ubc.caPurpose: The purpose of this study is to collect information about your feelings, attitudes, past experiences, and personal characteristics. Researchers may use this information to screen you for other studies in the Human Subjects Pool (HSP) for which you may qualify. Researchers may also use this information to link pre-screening responses to data that was collected in a laboratory setting, or to collect data on an independent research project using questionnaires included in the pre-screening survey.Study Procedure: If you decide to participate, you will be asked to complete a series of surveys. These surveys reflect the diverse interests of members of the Psychology department, and therefore the questions will span a broad range of topics, including some topics you might consider sensitive; specifically, this pre-screening survey includes questions about your ethnocultural background, religious beliefs and affiliations, sexual practices, health conditions, and personal attitudes. There are no known risks associated with participation in this study and no known conflicts of interest on the part of the researchers. If you have any questions at anytime about the procedures or your involvement feel free to ask the researchers.Potential Risks: By responding to the pre-testing survey online, you will face the same kinds of risk to confidentiality that occurs whenever you enter personal information over the internet. However, every effort will be made to minimize these risks (e.g., the HSP website automatically encrypts the responses you enter).Potential Benefits: There are no benefits for participants, aside from the opportunity to learn about psychological research and to be directed toward studies that are relevant to them.Compensation: For your participation, you will receive one half-credit in the HSP system.Confidentiality: Any information you provide in this study will be kept strictly confidential. You will be asked to create a code number, which will be linked to the pre-testing responses you provide. If a researcher wishes to access your pre-testing data when you later complete a particular study, they will ask you to provide this code number; whether to do so is entirely at your discretion. Only HSP administrators will be able to access the data linking your name and code number, and this data will be stored on a password-protected computer in a locked office. In addition, if your pre-testing responses indicate that you meet the qualifications for particular studies, these studies will be automatically displayed to you by the online sign-up system; therefore, if you choose to sign up for a given study, the researchers will assume that you meet the qualifying criteria.Contact: If you have any other questions or desire further information with respect to this study, please contact Dr. Steve Heine (Phone: 604-822-6908. Email: heine@psych.ubc.ca)Contact for concerns about the rights of research subjects: If you have any concerns about your treatment or rights as a research subject, you may contact the Research Subject Information Line in the UBC Office of Research Services at 604-822-8598 or if long distance e-mail to RSIL@ors.ubc.ca.Consent:Your participation is entirely voluntary and you may refuse to participate or withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardy to any relationship you have with the University of British Columbia. If the questionnaire is completed, it will be assumed that consent has been given.",19
